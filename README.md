# Opaque Engine - ðŸš§ PRE ALPHA ðŸš§
A totally __free__ game- or general graphical application engine written in `C++` using the `Vulkan Rendering API`. This engine is currently under construction so its very buggy and has zero to no features. You can join the [discord](https://discord.gg/fEyYPTCG) for more info, if you have any questions and to contact me.
